Why?
----

In Spring 2014 I took CS 181, Formal Languages and Automata at UCLA.  
I found the various automata we studied interesting, so I wanted to try
my hand at implementing them, both for fun and as a challenge to get better at Rust.
I also wanted to see what it was like trying to covert the algorithms and properties
we studied into actual code.

The name Hephaestus
-------------------

Hephaestus was the Greek god of metals (among other things), and the creator of the automatons.
His association with metals and crafting has a nice thematic association with Rust (even though
it was named after a fungus rather than the metal), and as the builder of the automata, fits nicely
with the aim of the library.

Thanks to [Harrison Liddiard](https://github.com/liddiard) for coming up with the name.
