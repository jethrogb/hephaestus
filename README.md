Automata for Rust


Progress
======
* Deterministic Finite Automata: Implemented  
* Non-deterministic Finite Automata: In progress  
* DFA Transformations (Complement, union, intersection): Done
* NFA to DFA compilation and NFA transformations: Up next
* PDA: Yet to come

Why?
----

In Spring 2014 I took CS 181, Formal Languages and Automata at UCLA.  
I found the various automata we studied interesting, so I wanted to try
my hand at implementing them, both for fun and as a challenge to get better at Rust.
I also wanted to see what it was like trying to covert the algorithms and theorems
we studied into actual code.

The name Hephaestus
-------------------

Hephaestus was the Greek god of metals (among other things) and the builder of the automatons.
His association with metals fits nicely with Rust (Rust was named after a fungus, but whatever), and 
as the creator of the automatons, matches the aim of the library.

Thanks to [Harrison Liddiard](https://github.com/liddiard) for coming up with the name.
